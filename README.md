# d43-catalog

These are the AWS Lambda functions for generating the [API v3 catalog endpoint](https://api.door43.org/v3/catalog) from the [Door43 Resource Catalog](https://git.door43.org/Door43-Catalog) organization in our Door43 Git Service.


## Requirements
* Python 2.7

## How it Works

When a new repository is added or forked into the [Door43 Resource Catalog](https://git.door43.org/Door43-Catalog) organization a chain reaction is started that eventually adds the content into our [API v3 catalog endpoint](https://api.door43.org/v3/catalog), assuming all the checks passed.  Here is an overview:

1. Someone creates a new repo or forks a repo into the [Door43 Resource Catalog](https://git.door43.org/Door43-Catalog) organization
1. A webhook for the organization notifies the Lambda pipeline of new or updated content
1. The Lambda pipeline:
  * Grabs the content and deciphers metadata
  * Adds entry into an "in progress" database table
  * Puts the files to be signed on S3 in the cdn.door43.org bucket, keyed with `temp/<repo-name>/<commit-hash>/<filename>`
  * A cron job on AWS triggers a digital signing routine runs on a schedule that uses cryptographic verification and puts it on S3 as `cdn.door43.org/<lang>/<resource>/v<version>/<filename>`
  * A cron job on AWS triggers the catalog.json generator (Lambda) ever 5 minutes. If there are new changes to the "in progress" DB, and all files have been signed and all JSON checks out, it copies the new catalog.json to the (S3) API endpoint

## Function Description

The following provides a functional description of the functions in this repository.

### webhook 

This is the first function that is called by the organization's webhook and it does the following:

* [x] Accept webhook from Gogs org (need to test the org webhook)
* [x] Load manifest files from repo to be added/modified (via HTTPS)
* [x] Format correctly new entries, per https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/wiki/API-v3-Resource-Catalog-Endpoint#catalog-structure (assume input manifest looks like http://resource-container.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manifest.html )
* [x] Save to the In Progress database table, with timestamp
* [x] Copy data in `formats` key into S3 bucket cdn.door43.org/temp/ to be signed

### signing

This function is run via AWS cron every 5 minutes and it does the following:

- [x] Signs a single file in S3 bucket (cdn.door43.org/temp/) (which was written by webhook function above)
- [x] Verifies that signature checks out
- [x] Move data file out of /temp/ into correct directory... cdn.door43.org/[lang]/[slug]/[content_ver]/[format_type]/[file]
- [x] Upload the signature as `.sig` file in above directory
- [x] Add signature URL to the In Progress DB
- [x] Update data URL in the In Progress DB

### catalog

This function is run via AWS cron every 5 minutes and it does the following:

- [x] Consistency check on In Progress DB
  - [x] If it's not consistent it fails
    - [x] Sigs are missing == inconsistent
    - [x] Incorrect formatting ==  inconsistent
    - [x] If it fails increment a integer in a DB table
    - [x] If fail integer > 4, send an email (ask Jesse where to send)
  - [x] If it is consistent, zero the failed DB table
- [x] Copy the rows from In Progress DB to Production DB
  - [x] Never overwrite
  - [x] Use timestamps as keys (to support specific date querying at a later date)
- [x] Saves latest Production DB to `catalog.json` on S3 bucket
- [x] Update to S3 file triggers acceptance test below
- [x] Records the catalog status in a status table

### acceptance

After a new catalog file is written to S3, this function does the following:

- [x] Make sure structure of catalog file is correct
- [x] Make HEAD request for each resource (every URL) in catalog to verify it exists
- [x] Emails any errors to the specified email addresses

Technically this is all duplicate testing of what we are alreadying doing elsewhere in the pipeline.  This function is the "oops" catcher.

### fork

This function is run via AWS cron every 5 minutes and it does the following:

- [x] Checks if there are new repositories in the [Door43 Resource Catalog](https://git.door43.org/Door43-Catalog) organization
- [x] Triggers the webhook lambda for each new repository found.

### ts_v2_catalog

This function is run via AWS cron every 5 minutes and it does the following:

- [x] Checks for a new v3 catalog in the status table
- [x] Builds a v2 tS api from the new/updated v3 catalog.

### uw_v2_catalog

This function is run via AWS cron every 5 minutes and it does the following:

- [x] Checks for a new v3 catalog in the status table
- [x] Builds a v2 uW api from the new/updated v3 catalog.

## Tools

###CSV to USFM3

This tool will convert a csv file containing Greek words to USFM 3 format.
You may execute the following command to learn how to use the tool.

```bash
python execute.py csvtousfm3 -h
